  abstract = {In visual data exploration with scatter plots, no single plot is sufficient to analyze complicated high-dimensional data sets. Given numerous visualizations created with different features or methods, meta-visualization is needed to analyze the visualizations together. We solve \emph{how to arrange numerous visualizations onto a meta-visualization display}, so that their similarities and differences can be analyzed. We introduce a machine learning approach to optimize the meta-visualization, based on an information retrieval perspective: two visualizations are similar if the analyst would retrieve similar neighborhoods between data samples from either visualization. Based on the approach, we introduce a nonlinear embedding method for meta-visualization: it optimizes locations of visualizations on a display, so that visualizations giving similar information about data are close to each other.},
