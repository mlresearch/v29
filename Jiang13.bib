  abstract = {Recommender systems are often based on collaborative filtering. Previous researches on collaborative filtering mainly focus on one single recommender or formulating hybrid with different approaches. In consideration of the problems of sparsity, recommender error rate, sample weight update, and potential, we adapt AdaBoost and propose two novel boosting frameworks for collaborative filtering. Each of the frameworks combines multiple homogeneous recommenders, which are based on the same collaborative filtering algorithm with different sample weights. We use seven popular collaborative filtering algorithms to evaluate the two frameworks with two MovieLens datasets of different scale. Experimental result shows the proposed frameworks improve the performance of collaborative filtering.},
