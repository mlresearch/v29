title: Locally-Linear Learning Machines (L3M)
abstract: 'We present locally-linear learning machines (L3M) for multi-class classification.
  We formulate a global convex risk function to jointly learn linear feature space
  partitions and region-specific linear classifiers. L3M’s features such as: (1) discriminative
  power similar to Kernel SVMs and Adaboost; (2) tight control on generalization error;
  (3) low training time cost due to on-line training; (4) low test-time costs due
  to local linearity; are all potentially well-suited for “big-data” applications.
  We derive tight convex surrogates for the empirical risk function associated with
  space partitioning classifiers. These empirical risk functions are non-convex since
  they involve products of indicator functions. We obtain a global convex surrogate
  by first embedding empirical risk loss as an extremal point of an optimization problem
  and then convexifying this resulting problem. Using the proposed convex formulation,
  we demonstrate improvement in classification performance, test and training time
  relative to common discriminative learning methods on challenging multiclass data
  sets.'
