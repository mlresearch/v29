title: Generalized Aitchison Embeddings for Histograms
abstract: Learning distances that are specifically designed to compare histograms
  in the probability simplex has recently attracted the attention of the community.
  Learning such distances is important because most machine learning problems involve
  bags of features rather than simple vectors. Ample empirical evidence suggests that
  the Euclidean distance in general and Mahalanobis metric learning in particular
  may not be suitable to quantify distances between points in the simplex. We propose
  in this paper a new contribution to address this problem by generalizing a family
  of embeddings proposed by Aitchison (1982) to map the probability simplex onto a
  suitable Euclidean space. We provide algorithms to estimate the parameters of such
  maps, and show that these algorithms lead to representations that outperform alternative
  approaches to compare histograms.
