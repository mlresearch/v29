title: Polynomial Runtime Bounds for Fixed-Rank Unsupervised Least-Squares Classification
abstract: Maximum margin clustering can be regarded as the direct extension of support
  vector machines to unsupervised learning scenarios. The goal is to partition unlabeled
  data into two classes such that a subsequent application of a support vector machine
  would yield the overall best result (with respect to the optimization problem associated
  with support vector machines). While being very appealing from a conceptual point
  of view, the combinatorial nature of the induced optimization problem renders a
  direct application of this concept difficult. In order to obtain efficient optimization
  schemes, various surrogates of the original problem definition have been proposed
  in the literature. In this work, we consider one of these variants, called unsupervised
  regularized least-squares classification, which is based on the square loss, and
  develop polynomial upper runtime bounds for the induced combinatorial optimization
  task. In particular, we show that for n patterns and kernel matrix of fixed rank
  r (with given  eigendecomposition), one can obtain an optimal solution in \mathcalO(n^r)
  time for r ≤2 and in \mathcalO(n^r-1) time for r≥3. The algorithmic framework is
  based on an interesting connection to the field of quadratic zero-one programming
  and permits the computation of exact solutions for the more general case of non-linear
  kernel functions in polynomial time.
