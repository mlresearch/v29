title: Active Sampling of Pairs and Points for Large-scale Linear Bipartite Ranking
abstract: Bipartite ranking is a fundamental ranking problem that learns to order
  relevant instances ahead of irrelevant ones. One major approach for bipartite ranking,
  called the pair-wise approach, tackles an equivalent binary classification problem
  of whether one instance out of a pair of instances should be ranked higher than
  the other. Nevertheless, the number of instance pairs constructed from the input
  data could be quadratic to the size of the input data, which makes pair-wise ranking
  generally infeasible on large-scale data sets. Another major approach for bipartite
  ranking, called the point-wise approach, directly solves a binary classification
  problem between relevant and irrelevant instance points. This approach is feasible
  for large-scale data sets, but the resulting ranking performance can be inferior.
  That is, it is difficult to conduct bipartite ranking accurately and efficiently
  at the same time. In this paper, we develop a novel scheme within the pair-wise
  approach to conduct bipartite ranking efficiently. The scheme, called Active Sampling,
  is inspired from the rich field of active learning and can reach a competitive ranking
  performance while focusing only on a small subset of the many pairs during training.
  Moreover, we propose a general Combined Ranking and Classification (CRC) framework
  to accurately conduct bipartite ranking. The framework unifies point-wise and pair-wise
  approaches and is simply based on the idea of treating each instance point as a
  pseudo-pair. Experiments on 14 real- word large-scale data sets demonstrate that
  the proposed algorithm of Active Sampling within CRC, when coupled with a linear
  Support Vector Machine, usually outperforms state-of-the-art point-wise and pair-wise
  ranking approaches in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.
