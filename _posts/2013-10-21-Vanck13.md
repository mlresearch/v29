title: Using Hyperbolic Cross Approximation to measure and compensate Covariate Shift
abstract: The concept of covariate shift in supervised data analysis describes a difference
  between the training and test distribution while the conditional distribution remains
  the same.  To improve the prediction performance one can address such a change by
  using individual weights for each training datapoint, which emphasizes the training
  points close to the test data set so that these get a higher significance. We propose
  a new method for calculating such weights by minimizing a Fourier series approximation
  of distance measures, in particular we consider the total variation distance, the
  Euclidean distance and Kullback-Leibler divergence. To be able to use the Fourier
  approach for higher dimensional data, we employ the so-called hyperbolic cross approximation.
  Results show that the new approach can compete with the latest methods and that
  on real life data an improved performance can be obtained.
