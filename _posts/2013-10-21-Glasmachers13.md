title: Accelerated Coordinate Descent with Adaptive Coordinate Frequencies
abstract: Coordinate descent (CD) algorithms have become the method of choice for
  solving a number of machine learning tasks. They are particularly popular for training
  linear models, including linear support vector machine classification, LASSO regression,
  and logistic regression. We propose an extension of the CD algorithm, called the
  adaptive coordinate frequencies (ACF) method. This modified CD scheme does not treat
  all coordinates equally, in that it does not pick all coordinates equally often
  for optimization. Instead the relative frequencies of coordinates are subject to
  online adaptation. The resulting optimization scheme can result in significant speed-ups.
  We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach on a number of large scale machine
  learning problems.
