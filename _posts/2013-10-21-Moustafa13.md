title: 'Learning a Metric Space for Neighbourhood Topology Estimation: Application
  to Manifold Learning'
abstract: Manifold learning algorithms rely on a neighbourhood graph to provide an
  estimate of the data’s local topology. Unfortunately, current methods for estimating
  local topology assume local Euclidean geometry and locally uniform data density,
  which often leads to poor data embeddings. We address these shortcomings by proposing
  a framework that combines local learning with parametric density estimation for
  local topology estimation. Given a data set \mathcalD ⊂\mathcalX, we first estimate
  a new metric space (\mathbbX,d_\mathbbX) that characterizes the varying sample density
  of \mathcalX in \mathbbX, then use (\mathbbX,d_\mathbbX) as a new (pilot) input
  space for the graph construction step of the manifold learning process. The proposed
  framework results in significantly improved embeddings, which we demonstrated objectively
  by assessing clustering accuracy.
