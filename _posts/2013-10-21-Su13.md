title: Multilabel Classification through Random Graph Ensembles
abstract: We present new methods for multilabel classification, relying on ensemble
  learning on a collection of random output graphs imposed on the multilabel and a
  kernel-based structured output learner as the base classifier. For ensemble learning,
  differences among the output graphs provide the required base classifier diversity
  and lead to improved performance in the increasing size of the ensemble. We study
  different methods of forming the ensemble prediction, including majority voting
  and two methods that perform inferences over the graph structures before or after
  combining the base models into the ensemble. We compare the methods against the
  state-of-the-art machine learning approaches on a set of heterogeneous multilabel
  benchmark problems, including multilabel AdaBoost, convex multitask feature learning,
  as well as single target learning approaches represented by Bagging and SVM. In
  our experiments, the random graph ensembles are very competitive and robust, ranking
  first or second on most of the datasets. Overall, our results show that random graph
  ensembles are viable alternatives to flat multilabel and multitask learners.
