title: 'Coinciding Walk Kernels: Parallel Absorbing Random Walks for Learning with
  Graphs and Few Labels'
abstract: Exploiting autocorrelation for node-label prediction in networked data has
  led to great success. However, when dealing with sparsely labeled networks, common
  in present-day tasks, the autocorrelation assumption is difficult to exploit. Taking
  a step beyond, we propose the coinciding walk kernel (cwk), a novel kernel leveraging
  label-structure similarity – the idea that nodes with similarly arranged labels
  in their local neighbourhoods are likely to have the same label – for learning problems
  on partially labeled graphs. Inspired by the success of random walk based schemes
  for the construction of graph kernels, cwk is defined in terms of the probability
  that the labels encountered during parallel random walks coincide. In addition to
  its intuitive probabilistic interpretation, coinciding walk kernels outperform existing
  kernel- and walk-based methods on the task of node-label prediction in sparsely
  labeled graphs with high label-structure similarity. We also show that computing
  cwks is faster than many state-of-the-art kernels on graphs. We evaluate cwks on
  several real- world networks, including cocitation and coauthor graphs, as well
  as a graph of interlinked populated places extracted from the dbpedia knowledge
  base.
