title: Stability of Multi-Task Kernel Regression Algorithms
abstract: We study the stability properties of nonlinear multi-task regression in
  reproducing Hilbert spaces with operator-valued kernels.  Such kernels, a.k.a. multi-task
  kernels, are appropriate for learning problems with nonscalar outputs like multi-task
  learning and structured output prediction. We show that multi-task kernel regression
  algorithms are uniformly stable in the general case of infinite-dimensional output
  spaces.  We then derive under mild assumption on the kernel generalization bounds
  of such algorithms, and we show their consistency even with non Hilbert-Schmidt
  operator-valued kernels. We demonstrate how to apply the results to various multi-task
  kernel regression methods such as vector-valued SVR and functional ridge regression.
