title: Second Order Online Collaborative Filtering
abstract: Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the most successful learning techniques
  in building real-world recommender systems. Traditional CF algorithms are often
  based on batch machine learning methods which suffer from several critical drawbacks,
  e.g., extremely expensive model retraining cost whenever new samples arrive, unable
  to capture the latest change of user preferences over time, and high cost and slow
  reaction to new users or products extension. Such limitations make batch learning
  based CF methods unsuitable for real-world online applications where data often
  arrives sequentially and user preferences may change dynamically and rapidly. To
  address these limitations, we investigate online collaborative filtering techniques
  for building live recommender systems where the CF model can evolve on-the-fly over
  time. Unlike the regular first order CF algorithms (e.g., online gradient descent
  for CF) that converge slowly, in this paper, we present a new framework of second
  order online collaborative filtering, i.e., Confidence Weighted Online Collaborative
  Filtering (CWOCF), which applies the second order online optimization methodology
  to tackle the online collaborative filtering task. We conduct extensive experiments
  on several large-scale datasets, in which the encouraging results demonstrate that
  the proposed algorithms obtain significantly lower errors (both RMSE and MAE) than
  the state-of-the-art first order CF algorithms when receiving the same amount of
  training data in the online learning process.
