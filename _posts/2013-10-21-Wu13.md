title: 'Multi-Label Classification with Unlabeled Data: An Inductive Approach'
abstract: The problem of multi-label classification has attracted great interests
  in the last decade. Multi-label classification refers to the problems where an example
  that is represented by a \emphsingle instance can be assigned to \emphmore than
  one category. Until now, most of the researches on multi-label classification have
  focused on supervised settings whose assumption is that large amount of labeled
  training data is available. Unfortunately, labeling training example is expensive
  and time-consuming, especially when it has more than one label. However, in many
  cases abundant unlabeled data is easy to obtain. Current attempts toward exploiting
  unlabeled data for multi-label classification work under the \emphtransductive setting,
  which aim at making predictions on existing unlabeled data while can not generalize
  to new unseen data. In this paper, the problem of \emphinductive semi-supervised
  multi-label classification is studied, where a new approach named \textsliMLCU,
  i.e. \emphinductive Multi-Label Classification with Unlabeled data, is proposed.
  We formulate the inductive semi-supervised multi-label learning as an optimization
  problem of learning linear models and ConCave Convex Procedure \textsl(CCCP) is
  applied to optimize the non-convex optimization problem. Empirical studies on twelve
  diversified real-word multi-label learning tasks clearly validate the superiority
  of \textsliMLCU against the other well-established multi-label learning approaches.
