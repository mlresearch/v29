title: 'Exploration vs Exploitation vs Safety: Risk-Aware Multi-Armed Bandits'
abstract: 'Motivated by applications in energy management, this paper presents the
  Multi-Armed Risk-Aware Bandit (MaRaB) algorithm. With the goal of limiting the exploration
  of risky arms, MaRaB takes as arm quality its conditional value at risk. When the
  user-supplied risk level goes to 0, the arm quality tends toward the essential infimum
  of the arm distribution density, and MaRaB tends toward the MIN multi-armed bandit
  algorithm, aimed at the arm with maximal minimal value. As a first contribution,
  this paper presents a theoretical analysis of the MIN algorithm under mild assumptions,
  establishing its robustness comparatively to UCB. The analysis is  supported by
  extensive experimental validation of MIN and MaRaB compared to UCB and  state-of-art
  risk-aware MAB algorithms on  artificial and real-world problems. '
