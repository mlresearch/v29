title: Unconfused Ultraconservative Multiclass Algorithms
abstract: 'We tackle the problem of learning linear classifiers from noisy datasets
  in a multiclass setting. The two-class version of this problem was studied a few
  years ago by, e.g. Bylander (1994) and Blum et al. (1996): in these contributions,
  the proposed approaches to fight the noise revolve around a Perceptron learning
  scheme fed with peculiar examples computed through a weighted average of points
  from the noisy training set. We propose to build upon these approaches and we introduce
  a new algorithm called \uma (for Unconfused Multiclass additive Algorithm) which
  may be seen as a generalization to the multiclass setting of the previous approaches.
  In order to characterize the noise we use the \em confusion matrix as a multiclass
  extension of the classification noise studied in the aforementioned literature.
  Theoretically well-founded, \uma furthermore displays very good empirical noise
  robustness, as evidenced by numerical simulations conducted on both synthetic  and
  real data.'
