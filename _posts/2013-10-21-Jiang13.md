title: Novel Boosting Frameworks to Improve the Performance of Collaborative Filtering
abstract: Recommender systems are often based on collaborative filtering. Previous
  researches on collaborative filtering mainly focus on one single recommender or
  formulating hybrid with different approaches. In consideration of the problems of
  sparsity, recommender error rate, sample weight update, and potential, we adapt
  AdaBoost and propose two novel boosting frameworks for collaborative filtering.
  Each of the frameworks combines multiple homogeneous recommenders, which are based
  on the same collaborative filtering algorithm with different sample weights. We
  use seven popular collaborative filtering algorithms to evaluate the two frameworks
  with two MovieLens datasets of different scale. Experimental result shows the proposed
  frameworks improve the performance of collaborative filtering.
