title: Guided Monte Carlo Tree Search for Planning in Learned Environments
abstract: Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is a sampling and simulation based technique
  for searching in large search spaces containing both decision nodes and probabilistic
  events. This technique has recently become popular due to its successful application
  to games, e.g. Poker and Go. Such games have known rules and the alternation between
  self-moves and non-deterministic events or opponent moves can be used to prune uninteresting
  branches. In this paper we study a real-world setting where the processes in the
  domain have a high degree of uncertainty and the need for longer-term planning implies
  a sequence of (planning) decisions without any intermediate feedback. Fortunately,
  unlike the combinatorial complexity in strategic games, many real-world environments
  can be approximated by efficient algorithms on a short term. This paper proposes
  an MCTS variant using a new type of prior information based on estimating the effects
  of part of the world and explores its application to the problem of hospital planning,
  where machine learning algorithms can be used to predict the length of stay of patients
  for each of the different stages of their recovery.
