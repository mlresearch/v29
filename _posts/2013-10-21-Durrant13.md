title: 'Random Projections as Regularizers: Learning a Linear Discriminant Ensemble
  from Fewer Observations than Dimensions'
abstract: We examine the performance of an ensemble of randomly-projected Fisher Linear
  Discriminant classifiers, focusing on the case when there are fewer training observations
  than data dimensions. Our ensemble is learned from a sequence of randomly-projected
  representations of the original high dimensional data and therefore for this approach
  data can be collected, stored and processed in such a compressed form. The specific
  form and simplicity of this ensemble permits a direct and much more detailed analysis
  than existing generic tools in previous works.  In particular, we are able to derive
  the exact form of the generalization error of our ensemble, conditional on the training
  set, and based on this  we give theoretical guarantees which directly link the performance
  of the ensemble to that of the corresponding linear discriminant learned in the
  full data space. To the best of our knowledge these are the first theoretical results
  to prove such an explicit link for any classifier and classifier ensemble pair.
  Furthermore we show that the randomly-projected ensemble is equivalent to implementing
  a sophisticated regularization scheme to the linear discriminant learned in the
  original data space  and this prevents overfitting in conditions of small sample
  size where pseudo-inverse FLD learned in the data space is provably poor.
