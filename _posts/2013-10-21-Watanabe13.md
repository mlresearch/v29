title: Achievability of Asymptotic Minimax Regret in Online and Batch Prediction
abstract: 'The normalized maximum likelihood model achieves the minimax coding (log-loss)
  regret for data of fixed sample size n. However, it is a batch strategy, i.e., it
  requires that n be known in advance. Furthermore, it is computationally infeasible
  for most statistical models, and several computationally feasible alternative strategies
  have been devised. We characterize the achievability of asymptotic minimaxity by
  batch strategies (i.e., strategies that depend on n) as well as online strategies
  (i.e., strategies independent of n). On one hand, we conjecture that for a large
  class of models, no online strategy can be asymptotically minimax. We prove that
  this holds under a slightly stronger definition of asymptotic minimaxity. Our numerical
  experiments support the conjecture about non-achievability by so called last-step
  minimax algorithms, which are independent of n.  On the other hand, we show that
  in the multinomial model, a Bayes mixture defined by the conjugate Dirichlet prior
  with a simple dependency on n achieves asymptotic minimaxity for all sequences,
  thus providing a simpler asymptotic minimax strategy compared to earlier work by
  Xie and Barron. The numerical results also demonstrate superior finite-sample behavior
  by a number of novel batch and online algorithms. '
