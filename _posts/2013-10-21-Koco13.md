title: On multi-class classification through the minimization of the confusion matrix
  norm
abstract: 'In imbalanced multi-class classification problems, the misclassification
  rate as an error measure may not be a relevant choice. Several methods have been
  developed where the performance measure retained richer information than the mere
  misclassification rate: misclassification costs, ROC-based information, etc. Following
  this idea of dealing with alternate measures of performance, we propose to address
  imbalanced classification problems by using a new measure to be optimized: the norm
  of the confusion matrix. Indeed, recent results show that using the norm of the
  confusion matrix as an error measure can be quite interesting due to the fine-grain
  informations contained in the matrix,  especially in the case of imbalanced classes.
  Our first contribution then consists in showing that optimizing criterion based
  on the confusion matrix gives rise to a common background for cost-sensitive methods
  aimed at dealing with imbalanced classes learning problems. As our second contribution,
  we propose an extension of a recent multi-class boosting method — namely AdaBoost.MM
  — to the imbalanced class problem, by greedily minimizing  the empirical norm of
  the confusion matrix. A theoretical analysis of the properties of the proposed method
  is presented, while experimental results illustrate the behavior of the algorithm
  and show the relevancy of the approach compared to other methods.'
