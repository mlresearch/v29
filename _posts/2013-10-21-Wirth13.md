title: 'EPMC: Every Visit Preference Monte Carlo for Reinforcement Learning'
abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms are usually hard to use for non expert
  users. It is required to consider several aspects like the definition of state-,
  action- and reward-space as well as the algorithms hyperparameters. Preference based
  approaches try to address these problems by omitting the requirement for exact rewards,
  replacing them with preferences over solutions. Some algorithms have been proposed
  within this framework, but they are usually requiring parameterized policies which
  is again a hinderance for their application. Monte Carlo based approaches do not
  have this restriction and are also model free. Hence, we present a new preference-based
  reinforcement learning algorithm, utilizing Monte Carlo estimates. The main idea
  is to estimate the relative Q-value of two actions for the same state within a every-visit
  framework. This means, preferences are used to estimate the Q-value of state-action
  pairs within a trajectory, based on the feedback concerning the complete trajectory.
  The algorithm is evaluated on three common benchmark problems, namely mountain car,
  inverted pendulum and acrobot, showing its advantage over a closely related algorithm
  which is also using estimates for intermediate states, but based on a probability
  theorem. In comparison to SARSA(λ), EPMC converges somewhat slower, but computes
  policies that are almost as good or better.
