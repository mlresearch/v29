title: Information Retrieval Perspective to Meta-visualization
abstract: 'In visual data exploration with scatter plots, no single plot is sufficient
  to analyze complicated high-dimensional data sets. Given numerous visualizations
  created with different features or methods, meta-visualization is needed to analyze
  the visualizations together. We solve \emphhow to arrange numerous visualizations
  onto a meta-visualization display, so that their similarities and differences can
  be analyzed. We introduce a machine learning approach to optimize the meta-visualization,
  based on an information retrieval perspective: two visualizations are similar if
  the analyst would retrieve similar neighborhoods between data samples from either
  visualization. Based on the approach, we introduce a nonlinear embedding method
  for meta-visualization: it optimizes locations of visualizations on a display, so
  that visualizations giving similar information about data are close to each other.'
