title: Linear Approximation to ADMM for MAP inference
abstract: Maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference is one of the fundamental inference
  tasks in graphical models.  MAP inference is in general NP-hard, making approximate
  methods of interest for many problems. One successful class of approximate inference
  algorithms is based on linear programming (LP) relaxations. The augmented Lagrangian
  method can be used to overcome a lack of strict convexity in LP relaxations, and
  the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) provides an elegant algorithm
  for finding the saddle point of the augmented Lagrangian. Here we present an ADMM-based
  algorithm to solve the primal form of the MAP-LP whose closed form updates are based
  on a linear approximation technique. Our technique gives efficient, closed form
  updates that converge to the global optimum of the LP relaxation. We compare our
  algorithm to two existing ADMM-based MAP-LP methods, showing that our technique
  is faster on general, non-binary or non-pairwise models.
