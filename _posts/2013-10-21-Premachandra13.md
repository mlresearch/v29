title: Aggregating Predictions via Sequential Mini-Trading
abstract: Prediction markets which trade on contracts representing unknown future
  outcomes are designed specifically to aggregate expert predictions via the market
  price. While there are some existing machine learning interpretations for the market
  price and connections to Bayesian updating under the equilibrium analysis of such
  markets, there is less of an understanding of what the instantaneous price in sequentially
  traded markets means. In this paper we show that the prices generated in sequentially
  traded prediction markets are stochastic approximations to the price given by an
  equilibrium analysis. We do so by showing the equilibrium price is a solution to
  a stochastic optimisation problem which is solved by stochastic mirror descent (SMD)
  by a class of sequential pricing mechanisms. This connection leads us to propose
  a scheme called “mini-trading” which introduces a parameter related to the learning
  rate in SMD. We prove several properties of this scheme and show that it can improve
  the stability of prices in sequentially traded prediction markets.
