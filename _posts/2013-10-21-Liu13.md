title: Linearized Alternating Direction Method with Parallel Splitting and Adaptive
  Penalty for Separable Convex Programs in Machine Learning
abstract: Many problems in statistics and machine learning (e.g., probabilistic graphical
  model, feature extraction, clustering and classification, etc) can be (re)formulated
  as linearly constrained separable convex programs. The traditional alternating direction
  method (ADM) or its linearized version (LADM) is for the two-variable case and \emphcannot
  be naively generalized to solve the multi-variable case. In this paper, we propose
  LADM with parallel splitting and adaptive penalty (LADMPSAP) to solve multi-variable
  separable convex programs efficiently. When all the component objective functions
  have bounded subgradients, we obtain convergence results that are stronger than
  those of ADM and LADM, e.g., allowing the penalty parameter to be unbounded and
  proving the \emphsufficient and necessary conditions for global convergence. We
  further propose a simple optimality measure and reveal the convergence \emphrate
  of LADMPSAP in an ergodic sense. For programs with extra convex set constraints,
  we devise a practical version of LADMPSAP for faster convergence. LADMPSAP is particularly
  suitable for sparse representation and low-rank recovery problems because its subproblems
  have closed form solutions and the sparsity and low-rankness of the iterates can
  be preserved during the iteration. It is also \emphhighly parallelizable and hence
  fits for parallel or distributed computing. Numerical experiments testify to the
  speed and accuracy advantages of LADMPSAP.
