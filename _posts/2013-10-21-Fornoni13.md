title: Multiclass Latent Locally Linear Support Vector Machines
abstract: Kernelized Support Vector Machines (SVM) have gained the status of off-the-shelf
  classifiers, able to deliver state of the art performance on almost any problem.
  Still, their practical use is constrained by their computational and memory complexity,
  which grows super-linearly with the number of training samples. In order to retain
  the low training and testing complexity of linear classifiers and the flexibility
  of non linear ones, a growing, promising alternative is represented by methods that
  learn non-linear classifiers through local combinations of linear ones. In this
  paper we propose a new multi class local classifier, based on a latent SVM formulation.
  The proposed classifier makes use of a set of linear models that are linearly combined
  using sample and class specific weights. Thanks to the latent formulation, the combination
  coefficients are modeled as latent variables. We allow soft combinations and we
  provide a closed-form solution for their estimation, resulting in an efficient prediction
  rule. This novel formulation allows to learn in a principled way the sample specific
  weights and the linear classifiers, in a unique optimization problem, using a CCCP
  optimization procedure. Extensive experiments on ten standard UCI machine learning
  datasets, one large binary dataset, three character and digit recognition databases,
  and a visual place categorization dataset show the power of the proposed approach.
