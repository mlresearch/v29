  abstract = {We study the problem of learning from multiple views using kernel methods in a supervised setting.  We approach this  problem from a multi-task learning point of view and illustrate how to capture the interesting multimodal structure of the data using multi-task kernels.  Our analysis shows that the multi-task perspective offers the flexibility to design more efficient multiple-source learning algorithms, and hence the ability to exploit multiple descriptions of the data. In particular, we formulate the multimodal learning framework using vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, and we derive specific multi-task kernels that can operate over multiple modalities. Finally,  we analyze the vector-valued regularized least squares algorithm in this context, and demonstrate its potential in a series of experiments with a real-world multimodal data set.},
